- Retrieve a list of all rectangles.
- Retrieve a specific rectangle by its index.
- Modify an existing rectangle.
- Delete a rectangle by its index.
- Generate SVG code representing the rectangles.

### Technologies Used
- Spring Boot for building the application.
- Java for backend development.

### How to Run
1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and Maven installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
